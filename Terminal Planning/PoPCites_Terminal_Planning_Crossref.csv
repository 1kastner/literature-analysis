These tasks are often overlooked in the mechanical study of human movement due to the fact they carry with them very little biomechanical costs or effort. However, from a cognitive standpoint, these tasks carry high complexity. For example, the simple task of grabbing a cup and flipping it over is very easy mechanically and can be effortlessly achieved by a two year old. However, it is impossible to predict or simulate this motion without major intervention in the form of explicit constraints defining the task. The model itself cannot decide in which orientation the hand should assume in order to grasp the object. Also, it cannot decide where on the object the hand should be placed. These aspects must be assumed by the researcher and constrained in the formulation. In other words, digital human models, such as optimization-based motion prediction models, are unable to plan actions. This implies that for each task, a unique optimization formulation is needed in order to predict the motion/posture needed to complete each task. This paper presents a new method for task planning prediction within optimization based posture and motion prediction. It provides a new single optimization formulation that allows for the prediction of multiple unique manual manipulation tasks. The method is based on observations made from experimental studies on cognitive motor planning."

From the perspective of reliability, the amount of various kinds of TUs in different situations is studied, that is only TUs with tele-control function, only TUs without tele-control function, a hybrid of TUs with tele-control function and TUs without tele-control function. Some circuit breakers with current protection mounted on some branches arc investigated at length. The following conclusions arc drawn that only one TU for each feeder is the best choice from the viewpoint of benefit/cost ratio, and that the demanded amount of various kinds of TUs depends on the reliability performance desired, the time of isolating the fault section by manual operation, the time of reparation, and the frequency of failure per-year. A DAS planning example with 220 feeders is given to illustrate the proposed methodology."

This paper proposes a methodology for prioritization of the intermodal terminal’s development features, as the procedure in its planning process, leading to the design of the intermodal terminal in accordance with the needs of various stakeholders and the principles of the sustainable development. As the stakeholders often have conflicting interests and objectives, it is necessary to consider a broad set of requirements and developmental features that enable the fulfillment of the defined requirements. In order to solve the problem this paper proposes a new hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model that combines Delphi, Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methods in the fuzzy environment. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by solving an example of planning an intermodal terminal in Belgrade."

The aim of the article is the systematization of the tactics of preoperative planning of total hip arthroplasty in the terminal stage degenerative diseases in adolescents. Preoperative planning is very challenging in total hip arthroplasty in adolescents because in all cases on hip radiographs severe anatomical hypoplasia or destruction of both the pelvic and femoral components is visualized. Before the surgery, patients undergo a complex multifactorial examination: orthopedic status specification, X-ray and radio-functional diagnostics, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Examination results allow us to determine the anatomy of the acetabulum, the path of the femoral head within it, the defect type and the diameter of brim of the acetabulum area, its depth, the integrity of the walls and roof. The authors performed total hip arthroplasty in 32 patients aged 15-18 years (11 boys and 21 girls) with terminal stages degenerative-dystrophic diseases of the hip joint with the implementation of preoperative planning in accordance with described methods. Comparison of preoperative planning results with the clinical results of total hip arthroplasty in most cases showed the agreement of calculations with the intraoperative analysis data. After total arthroplasty, evaluation of patients’ hip joint function was from 92 to 100 points. Preoperative planning is one of the most important stages of total hip arthroplasty in adolescent orthopedics. It allows to obtain reliable information about the needed model of the endoprosthesis, the optimal size of its components, the depth of the acetabulum reaming, the level of the femoral neck resection, placement and orientation of the implant cup and the stem, the possibility of correction of the lower limbs length and to achieve good results in the treatment of patients with severe congenital or acquired hip defects and progressive thigh non-weight bearing."

This is the major significance of energy saving and environmental protection. Vehicle navigation control system based on green path planning regards saving vehicle fuel consumption as a starting point, the least fuel consumption as a goal, researches and selects the vehicles path. In-car terminal as an important part of the system is of great significance.

The maximum-dive trajectory was generated based on Eq.(3) for a constant maximum dynamic pressure. In the guidance, it was optimized to be Eq.(13) for the open-loop command of bank angle in HAC segment. The simplified closed-loop command of angle of attack contained errors of altitude and path angle except the controlled velocity. Energy propagating as Eq.(8) calculated the reference velocity for the speed brake to track. Finally, an illustrative example was given to confirm the efficiency of the trajectory planning algorithm and optimized command. The simulation results in Fig.2 and Fig.3 indicate the proposed trajectory planning algorithm and guidance method are useful for the gliding capability limited RLV's TAEM with initial deviations."

Survivability of the facility and operational downtime becomes an issue because of the considerably more challenging metocean conditions. In most cases, metocean conditions (typically related to swell) that dictate terminal operations are determined from ship mooring studies. A slight variation in wave height, period or direction could shift the condition from â€˜operationalâ€™ to â€˜downtimeâ€™. However, how do commissioned terminals make critical decisions on whether or when to shut down operations? A precise wave forecast at the terminal site becomes more critical than ever for terminal planning and operation."

With the emergence of automated vehicles (AVs), or so-called “self-driving vehicles,” these fundamentals could change. Airport stakeholders need to understand the impacts of the emerging AVs to airport planning, design, and operation. If the impact hurts the operational resilience and financial sustainability of the airports, the stakeholders should come up with countermeasures to alleviate the impacts and to ensure the smooth operation and continuous growth of the airport. To serve these needs, this study quantifies the potential impacts of AV on airport parking and ground access by building a simulation platform and applying scenario analyses. Two airports are selected for case study: Tampa, FL (TPA) and San Francisco, CA (SFO). To fill in the gaps of historical data, statistical methods are used to generate inputs for study airports based on historical information of passenger demand, ground access mode split, and parking categories and durations. Furthermore, future scenarios are developed based on reasonable assumptions of the emergence of AVs. Outcomes of the case study show that the emergence of AVs will significantly affect airport operation if nothing as of now was changed. However, the impacts could be different for airports that are more auto-dependent versus those in metropolitan areas with various ground access options. Moreover, this study discusses possible strategies that can help airports generate revenue in the era of emerging AVs."

Many diseases that once were expected to follow a sloping illness trajectory with predictable deterioration and ultimately death are now more commonly experienced as chronic illnesses. They require more medical and other resources and challenge the family's ability to cope for much longer periods. The knowledge, value, and skill base of social work, and its broad range of practice sites make it uniquely suited to contribute to the movement to improve the care of the dying. The Social Work Hospice and Palliative Care Network were formed in 2007 to advance and give voice to social work's expertise in this area and to promote its development in practice, education, research, and policy.</p>"
